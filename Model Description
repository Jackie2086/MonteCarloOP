Natural Gas Pipeline Valuation as a Rainbow Option

Figure 3 illustrates the abstracted business model behind the natural gas pipeline network in question. This network involves a single receiving site of natural gas at TETCO ELA, along with three delivery points at Sonat (B1), Florida Gas Zone 3 (B2), and Transco Zone 4 (B3). Figure 4 presents the historical price variations, expressed in $/MMBtu, at these four sites since 2019.

This business model can be analyzed as a rainbow option—a type of financial derivative where multiple underlying assets are involved—in this case, natural gas prices at various locations. The valuation of this pipeline network involves handling multiple short positions and multiple long positions on the price fluctuations across these four sites, which adds complexity similar to that of a multi-asset or "rainbow" option.

Model Application and Parameterization
To apply the valuation model, detailed in Section 2.2, for this specific test case, several critical parameters are required:

Starting Prices from Today’s Forward Curve: The model requires the initial simulated prices at each of the four sites. These prices are derived from the current forward curve, which provides expectations of future prices based on market conditions. The forward curve serves as the baseline for predicting future price movements and calculating the option's payoffs.

Price Correlation Between Sites: The correlation matrix between the price changes at the four different sites is crucial for accurately simulating the joint price dynamics. In this case, the correlation between the standard normal random variables representing the price changes at each site is derived from historical price data, as shown in Figure 4. This step ensures that the simulation captures the dependencies between the various locations, which are essential for the multi-asset option pricing.

Volatility Estimation: Each site’s price volatility is another critical input. The volatility for each location is inferred from the implied volatility at the Henry Hub (a benchmark for natural gas pricing) and extrapolated using a linear regression model that relates the volatilities at the four specific sites to the Henry Hub. This approach allows for more accurate volatility estimates across the network, accounting for regional variations in price movements. Volatility is a key determinant in pricing the rainbow option and managing the associated risks.

Implications for Delta Hedging and Efficiency Gains
Using TensorFlow’s autodiff functionality, we can compute the delta sensitivities for each of the sites involved in this pipeline network. The delta in this context represents the sensitivity of the pipeline’s future cash flows to changes in the price of natural gas at each site. By calculating these deltas efficiently, the operator can dynamically hedge against adverse price movements, ensuring that they maintain a balanced portfolio in response to real-time fluctuations in the market.

The use of TensorFlow and its computational graph structure allows for parallel processing of these multi-site simulations, enhancing both the speed and accuracy of the delta hedging process. This automated, real-time hedging capability translates into significant operational efficiency and cost savings, reducing exposure to volatile natural gas prices and enabling more precise risk management.

In summary, viewing the pipeline network as a rainbow option allows for a more robust valuation framework, where TensorFlow’s autodiff unit plays a pivotal role in calculating deltas and other risk metrics, leading to optimized hedging strategies and enhanced business value.
