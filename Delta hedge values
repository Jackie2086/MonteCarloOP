Figure 6a showcases the results of our delta hedging calculations. The comparison between the original model and our enhanced model highlights a significant improvement in hedging strategy. In the original model, delta hedging could only be executed at a single location, meaning operators were constrained to adjust their hedge position based on price changes at just one delivery site. This limitation often led to suboptimal risk management, as it failed to account for the potential benefits of a broader, multi-site hedging approach.

In contrast, our new model introduces the ability to hedge simultaneously at three delivery points—Sonat, Florida Gas Zone 3, and Transco Zone 4—by incorporating switching optionality into the valuation process. This multi-site hedging strategy provides far greater flexibility and allows the operator to react more effectively to price fluctuations across the entire network. By managing risk across multiple locations in real-time, the new model not only enhances the overall stability of cash flows but also helps to maintain a higher valuation for the pipeline network. This is because the enhanced delta hedging mitigates potential losses more effectively, leading to more consistent and robust financial performance, even in volatile market conditions.

Thus, the key improvement of this model lies in its ability to maintain a stronger valuation by optimizing delta hedging across multiple sites, leveraging the full optionality of the pipeline network. This approach results in better risk mitigation, maximized operational flexibility, and increased resilience against market fluctuations.
