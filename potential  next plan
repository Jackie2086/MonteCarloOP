Potential Actions
Based on the findings and advancements presented in this report, several key actions can be taken to further enhance the robustness and applicability of the model. These actions aim to address real-world complexities, improve accuracy, and expand the model’s practical use cases:

Incorporating More Realistic Market Factors: The current model assumes idealized conditions, but in practice, natural gas pipeline operations and other commodity markets face a range of complexities, such as regulatory restrictions, fluctuating operational costs, and market liquidity constraints. Going forward, integrating these real-world factors into the model will enable a more comprehensive and reliable valuation process. This step will provide a closer representation of actual market dynamics, allowing for better decision-making and risk management.

Enhancing Parameter Selection for Greater Accuracy: The accuracy of the model's outputs is heavily dependent on the precision of its input parameters, including volatilities, correlations, and price estimates. To ensure the model reflects market realities as closely as possible, future efforts should focus on refining parameter estimation methods. This could involve researching and comparing different approaches, such as machine learning techniques, statistical models, or advanced data analytics, to identify the most accurate and reliable sources of input. Improved parameter selection will lead to more trustworthy and actionable results.

Expanding Model Application to Real-World Deals: To fully realize the potential of the model, it should be applied to a broader range of real-world deals and contracts across various markets. By integrating the model into actual transaction workflows—such as those involving LNG, LPG, and diesel—we can further refine it based on practical outcomes and challenges. This real-world validation will ensure the model’s adaptability and effectiveness across different commodities, geographies, and market conditions, ultimately delivering greater value to businesses and stakeholders.

By implementing these actions, the model will become more robust, adaptable, and applicable across a wider range of industries and real-world scenarios, thereby providing more accurate and strategic insights into asset valuation and risk management.
